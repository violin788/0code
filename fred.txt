Fredericksburg
Why am I leaving you?
Know I took you for granted
You did everything for me
I was forgetting mine
Fredericksburg
You are exactly the same
And that's why I die for you
You are as depressed as I am
But just as good
And it's like you always told me
Away well, but still home-
Fredericksburg
That's where I fell in love
Where my heart broke
I never wanted to go back
But now I miss mine
Fredericksburg
And a nice lunch in town
Walks on Söder
Life at Östermalm
And Strandvägen harbor
Then you forgive me if I regret it
I promise you, I will do anywhere
It's like you always told me
Away good, but still best at home
Yes, it's like you always told me
Away well, but still home-
Fredericksburg
Please don't forget me
It was the two of us against the world
There at our cafe
Is it already too late?
Or do you listen to me because I regret it?
I'll do anything for you
Because you're the one I miss the most
Away good, but still best at home
Thanks so much
