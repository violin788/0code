The purpose of this website is to look at what happens to stocks after their
earnings reports.  A table is generated based on data we get from a data vendor which can be wrong, and tries to look at if the session after the
earnings are released the stock continues in the direction that it gaps overnight or reverses, based on the data we get from a vendor which could even be wrong.  Some stocks overcorrect through the gap and tend to reverse and other stocks continue in the same direction that it gapped which is an interesting phenomenon.  That a stock historically has done this does not mean that it will do so in the future, but, as stated, it is interesting to look at.  We are not responsible for any trades or actions taken on what the stock seems to have done in the past, based on the incorrect information which gives a wrong value in the table and analysis, we thought it was interesting to look at the activity in the sessions after trading and we couldn't finding any source on the net that tried to look at that.  We are not responsible for any trades or anything done based on this information.  By reading this website you are agreeing that any trade or action you take is you and your responsibility alone, we don't say anything, we don't even know if the information from our data vendor is correct, so, if you trade on this data, you are dumb.  We get our data from a data vendor, if the historical price data they give us is wrong, we can't do anything about it, so, if you trade based on this, that is your responsibility and your responsibility alone.  Good luck, but, you absolve us of anything, it's your trading, that's why the historical prices are listed, our data vendor could have them wrong, Lord knows, that being said, it is interesting to look at.  Good day.
