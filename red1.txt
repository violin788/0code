I've written some webpages using Python's Flask, and, a couple days ago somebody wrote that a person can host a Python Flask with something called Fly.io, but, they have to use something called Docker, and, does Fly.io do a good job of hosting the Python code? (self.learnpython)

When it comes to computing..I have seen that special types of software exist for certain things, for ex when doing computing and using a Python file to find an xls file in 500 with a specific title and then get rows 50-100, there are things like MariaDB/MySQL that do that do, but, how much faster?
